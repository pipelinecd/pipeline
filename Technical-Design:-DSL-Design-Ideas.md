# Domain-Specific Languague (DSL) Design

## Legenda
* **DSL**
  Domain Specific Language;
* **Pipeline definition**
  Defines the configurable pipeline that can be reused to be run with different execution configurations;
* **Execution configuration**
  Configuration to use when executing the pipeline definition; giving meaning to the pipeline. 

## Pipeline definition
The pipeline definition script is a DSL implemented in Groovy focussed on the domain of pipelines in the sense of Continuous Integration (CI), Continuous Delivery (CD), Continuous Deployment, Release Management and Release Orchestration. Or "Application Lifecycle Management" (ALM) - as the total picture is often called.

The pipeline definition is configurable. The execution configuration of the pipeline definition is decoupled from the pipeline definition, so a single pipeline definition can be executed with different execution configurations. This makes it possible, to just have one pipeline definition and as many execution configurations you want without the need of "cascading project" or "template inheritance" as implemented by other CI tools.

### Example configurations

#### Simple Continuous Integration pipeline
Pipeline definition:

```groovy
    environment {
        mvn: '3.0.5'
        git: '1.7.9.5'
        env.vars {
            EDITOR: 'nano'
        }
    }

    configuration {
        scm(name: latest, type: git) {
            url:           assertGitUrl
            branch:        assertString
            username:      assertString
            email:         assertEmail
            key {
                type:      assertString
                private:   assertString
            }
        }
    }

    environment.afterConfigure {
        prepare scm {
            file('.gitconfig') << '''
                [user]
                name = ${scm.latest.username}
                email = ${scm.latest.email}
            '''
            file('.ssh/id_rsa') << '${scm.latest.key.private}'
        }

        verify scm {
            run 'git ls-remote --exit-code ${scm.latest.url} ${scm.latest.branch}'
        }
    }

    stage commit {
        description: 'Compile and Test'
        run {
            env.vars {
                SOME_VAR: 'some value'
            }
            command: git clone ${scm.latest.url} --branch ${scm.latest.branch}
        }
        run 'mvn clean install'
    }

    stage document(dependsOn: commit) {
        description: 'Generate documentation'
        run 'mvn -P generate-docs'
    }

    stage inspect(dependsOn: commit) {
        description: 'Inspect the quality'
        run 'mvn sonar:sonar'
    }

    stage snapshot-release(dependsOn: inspect) {
        description: 'Do a snapshot release'
        run 'mvn deploy'
    }

    announce(type: email) {
        to: 'list@mailing.org'
    }
```

Required configuration to provide to the pipeline:

```groovy
    scm(name: latest) {
        url:           'git@github.com/myuser/myrepo'
        branch:        'develop'
        username:      'CI server'
        email:         'ci@mydomain.tld'
        key.private:   '....'
    }
```

When executed, the above pipeline would do the following:

1. Build an execution model based on provided configuration and the pipeline definition, containing:
    * a model that represents the required environment;
    * a configuration model based on provided configuration;
    * a configuration verification model based the configuration section of the pipeline definition; and
    * a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) of the stages that looks as following:
        * _commit_
            * _document_
            * _inspect_
                * _snapshot-release_

2. Prepare an execution environment containing:
    * maven version 3.0.5 on the PATH
    * git version 1.7.9.5 on the PATH
3. Verify that the provided configuration is valid according to the pipeline definition.
4. Do some additional environment preparation and verification after the configuration is found valid
   (e.g. verify that the provided scm configuration is correct by trying to connect).
5. Start executing the _commit_ stage, as that's the starting point of this graph of stages: 
    1. Start stage _document_
    2. Start stage _inspect_
        1. Start stage _snapshot-release_

If anything fails in this pipeline, it directly exits with a failure status.
The _document_ and _inspect_ stages could be started in parallel. As they are on the same level, if one of them fails, the other will continue to run until it finishes (successfully or not). At that point the pipeline will exit with a failure status.
