Using Pipeline with a Central Repository
===============
_Currently only git-based repositories are supported_  
When a user pushes to a central code repository like git, a pipeline is triggered based on the configuration that is located within the that git repository.

```
    +----------+        +----------+
    |   User   |        |          |
    |          | +----> | git repo |
    | git push |        |          |
    +----------+        +-+--------+
                          |
                          | git post-hook calls
                          |   via web-call
                          |
 +------------------------|-----------+
 |                        |           |
 |                        v           |
 |  +----------+       +----------+   |
 |  | Pipeline |<------| Pipeline |   |
 |  | Runner   |       | Listener |   |
 |  +----+-----+       +----------+   |
 |       |                            |
 |       v                            |
 |    Sent status                     |
 |    email                           |
 |                 +------------------+
 |                 |Runs on one server|
 +-----------------+------------------+
```
The simple set-up requires that the central code repository supports post-hooks as these are executed after code is committed/pushed to the repository. Git is such type of code repository.

Requirements
============
- A Linux-based server to run Pipeline on  
  **Note:** This server must be accessible via HTTP(S) from your central code repository
  - Java 7+
  - Git _(as currently only git is supported)_
  - _(Windows platform currently not tested, therefor may or may not work)_
- A central code repository that supports post-hooks eg.
  - [Github](http://github.com)
  - [GitLab](http://gitlab.org)
- Any tools your code requires for compiling, testing, etc (its pipeline)  
  **Note:** When working with Java code, it must currently support Java 7 as Pipeline itself and your project pipeline will use the same Java runtime

Installation
============
Installing Pipeline for this simple set-up is done as follows:

1. Download the Pipeline installation package
2. Unpack the installation package to a location of choice
3. Add `{unpack-location}/bin/` to your environment `PATH` variable
4. Start pipeline by executing the command `pipe-listen server`, the log output will tell that the server is running on port 8080
5. Register the Pipeline post-hook with the central code repository:
  - For Github this means, configure the Pipeline post hook url as `Service Hooks > Web Hook URLS`:  
        [http://{ip}:8080/providers/github](http://{ip}:8080/providers/github)
  - For GitLab this means, configure the Pipeline post hook url as `Settings > Web Hooks`:  
        [http://{ip}:8080/providers/gitlab](http://{ip}:8080/providers/gitlab)
6. That's it! On your next push to the central code repository, your pipeline should be triggered

Now, add a pipeline configuration to your project!

Configuration
=============
1. In the root of your code repository, create a `project.pipe` script
2. Configure the pipeline. 
- **Note:** Configuration is explained on [project pipeline configuration](User-Guide-Project-Pipeline-Configuration)
