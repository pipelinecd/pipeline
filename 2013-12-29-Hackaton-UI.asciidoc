At 29th of December 2013, we're doing a Hackaton on a or some UI(s) for Pipeline. The hackers can decide what type of UIs they create (CLI, GUI, Web-UI, ...) and for what user type the UIs are (dev, test, business, wallboard, ...).

Some requirements for the UIs:
- uses API provided by Pipeline
- view-only (for now)
- user-type specific

The API provided by Pipeline, is a REST API. During the hackaton the API will be extended as needed, though the implementation of the API will (most probably) be mocked at this time.

== Ideas for UIs
=== Developer Web-UI
A developer friendly view on the Pipelines

==== Use-cases

* Overview of (all accessible) pipelines
** support filtering
** have different kind of views, like list, grid, ...

* Pipeline specific view
** show queue?
** specific pipeline overview picture
** show details on-request
** option to show history?

* Pipeline statistics...
** For one specific pipeline
** For all pipelines
